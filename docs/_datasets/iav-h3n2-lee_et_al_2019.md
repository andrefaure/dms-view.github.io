## Mutational Antigenic Profiling experiment

Lee  <span style="font-style:italic">et al.</span>, 2019 mapped how all amino-acid mutations to a Influenza Virus surface protein affected the virus's ability to escape serum from different humans.
"Escape mutations" are defined as those mutations which are enriched, or positively differentially selected, in a cell-passage selection with serum compared to a mock cell-passage selection without serum.
